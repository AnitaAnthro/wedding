                        <p class="text-left">I met Adam via the internet. Yes, Match.com. (Please hire us and pay us for a commercial if you see this Match.com - k thanks.) We blindly met at a restaurant down the street, Urban Solace, after an awkward “stranger abduction” text conversation when Adam asked if he should pick me up at my home. After an amazing dinner where we laughed and talked non-stop, I didn’t want to it to end. Despite it being slightly improper, I asked Adam if he wanted to come back to my place to continue our date. We ended up watching South Park on my couch like old friends hanging out. It ended with a goodbye first kiss on my doorstep, followed by a text from Adam that said “Killer first date!!!!” From there he woo’d me with his super tanned thighs and Miller Lite drinking skills. It’s been the best 2.5+ years of my life getting to know and fall in love with my best friend.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">I met Anita through Match.com (or a bar as I initially told many friends). Our first date was at Urban Solace in North Park, where we met for dinner and drinks. She made me wait outside for her for about 15-20 minutes as she “found parking”, which I found out later is her version of doing a drive-by to make sure I met her standards. Luckily, I did, and she “found” parking. The night was great, we laughed and talked throughout the entire dinner, and when it was time to leave, she asked me if I would like to hang at her house for a little bit before I went home (in a very PG version). We spent the rest of the evening watching South Park, of which I have extreme fondness for, and laughed and got to know each other. I gave her a kiss goodnight (after getting her ok) and went on my way. When I got home, I had to text her…“Killer First Date!!!”.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h3>HERS</h3>
                        <p class="text-left">Adam was leaving on a 10 day surf trip in Panama with the boys. After learning he didn’t get vaccinated (ugh!) and reading up on Malaria and various disasters that could befall him in Panama, I not only armed him with plenty of bug spray but also requested we have a romantic date night before he left. He complied, and on a hot and sweltering Sunday, September 1st, (Labor Day weekend) we went out to dinner at the place we first met, Urban Solace. We were seated on the back patio outside under the lights, it was so romantic. Adam was encouraging me to “Live it up!” so we got a bottle of wine, steak dinner, desserts... we partied and had a great time. When they brought the dessert tray out, written on it in chocolate were the words, “Will You Marry Me?” I looked at Adam in shock, and he was already down on one knee with the ring out. I immediately, of course, started crying. (Be prepared for more of this at our wedding.) I hugged him and kissed him, and then he had to remind me to answer him. That was when I said “YES!” The whole restaurant clapped and cheered and it was just like a movie scene. I later found out our good buddy, Vince Trang was in the restaurant and was one of the people cheering! It was very random and I took it as a very good sign for our future. After that we went home, opened another bottle of chilled wine, and sat outside on my porch calling all of our close friends and family with the news. It was perfect.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>HIS</h3>
                        <p class="text-left">After a wonderful two years of dating, it was clear that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Anita and would ask her to marry me. The first issue was that of finding the right ring for my bride to be.  Luckily, for anyone that knows Anita, she can give not-so-subtle hints of what she wants. I am also lucky that I have a good friend, Mark Pavlovits, who is a jeweler by trade and offered to lend his assistance in finding the right ring for Anita. The second issue was asking both Anita’s mom and dad for their blessing prior to the proposal. Through some very 007-esque reconnaissance (sneaking into Anita’s cell phone to get both her parents phone numbers when she stepped out of the room), I was able to get in touch with both of them and receive their blessings. The third and final issue was determining what to do for the actual proposal.  I thought, “What better place to propose than where we had our first date, Urban Solace?”</p>
                        <p class="text-left">I decided I wanted to propose before leaving for a 2 week surf trip to Panama in September, so set the proposal date for September 1st, 2013. Urban Solace was great, they were excited for me to propose there, and were a huge help even offering to take pictures on my phone during the proposal. In the whole whirlwind of me planning all of this, with Anita not knowing, she started to express that she would like to spend some time together prior to my trip. I told her “How about we go to a nice dinner the weekend before I head out of town?  How about Urban Solace, we haven’t been there in a while?” This set up my proposal under the guise of an “I’ll miss you while I am gone” kind of dinner date.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">On the day of the proposal, we were going through a bit of a heat wave, and I was sweating uncomfortably along with being nervous when we were initially sat at a table in the corner (picked for it’s romantic privacy), but the corner was trapping the heat. I asked them to move us and they placed us on the other end of the patio. The food, drinks, and conversation were great, Anita looked beautiful as always, and I was ready! The plan was to have dessert (Anita will never turn down a little dessert) and on the dessert tray, the chef wrote “Will You Marry Me” in chocolate. I got down on one knee, pulled out the ring and said “Anita, I love you with all of my heart, will you marry me?”  After a few moments of staring at the ring, at me, and tearing up, I said “You haven’t answered my question.” She then, to my relief, said yes.  PS. After all of the pictures and congratulations, our friend, Vince Trang, happened to be on the patio having dinner with a couple of friends and said “Wait a minute, that was you guys?!?!?!”…classic.</p>
