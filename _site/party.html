                        <p class="text-left">I've known Jennifer since my sophomore year of high school, when we both had 7th period off. She was hanging with our mutual friend Torey on the steps, and I said "I like your tube top." From there we went on a joint venture to 7-11 to get beef jerky sticks and Slurpee's, and we have been BFF's ever since. Her family has also taken me in and made me one of their own, and I consider her mother Josie a mom to me as well, which makes Jennifer almost a true sister. Considering we talk and sound exactly alike, we might as well be. ;-) Her dogs, Coco and Kaya, are also super adorable and fluffy and I enjoy being an auntie to them. (Although Coco and I get along a bit better, he is a ladies dog after all.) I just decided I’m going to talk about everyone’s pets on here too, because they are friends of mine as well.</p>

                        <p class="text-left"><br/>Kevin is one of my best friends that I met and lived with during my college and post college years. We initially met when he became “guy who is crashing on our couch for a while”, which shortly transformed to our roommate and good friend.  We lived together for a cumulative total of over 6 years and I just can’t say enough good things about the guy. He is always fun to hang out with and we have enjoyed many good times together whether it’s an out of the country surf trip, an Iron Maiden or Danzig show, or just getting together for a couple beers and some laughs. I am honored that he will be up there for me on the big day.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">Jennifer (AKA “Jenbo”) is one of my best friends that I've known since Jr. High. We share similar backgrounds, horrible/ amazing senses of humor, and a love of all things gnomes, Disneyland, and wacky adventure. One of the best experiences of my life was traveling through Japan with her. I can't imagine my life without her in it. She is amazing at letting me vent, making jokes that crack me up, and also making me cry with her big heart. She is essential to me in this "journey". Her cat, Marwhisker Hargitay, is my cuddle partner when I visit her in LA.</p>

                        <h3>Kat Gunsur</h3>
                        <p class="text-left">Kat is one of my oldest friends in San Diego. She cheers on and trains people for marathons, competes in triathlons and is a certified IRON WOMAN. She is honestly one of the most positive people I know, and is the person that literally SCREAMED over the phone when I called to tell her Adam and I were engaged. She also cried when I asked her to be one of my bridesmaids. I loved ALL these amazing dramatic reactions. She is also another crazy cat lady with her cats Megatron and Bumblebee, so we share that, which is cool.</p>

Her and I have had multiple wine nights where we talk for hours with amazing heart to hearts. She is also basically a living breathing Pinterest board of amazingness, and has “gilded” almost every surface of her apartment in gold paint. Her cat, Shadow, is also a crazy wildcat she saved from the mean streets of Diego.</p>

                        <h3>Maritza Rodriguez</h3>
                        <p class="text-left">I met Maritza in Chico through Jennifer Johnson, where we met and drank pitchers of Sierra Nevada beer together. After that she became my roommate when she moved to San Diego. Not only was she a fantastic roommate, but she is a great beer drinking buddy, neighbor, happy hour experimenter, fashion expert, beauty advice guru, animal lover, picnic partner, and wedding advice person. Her dog, Roxy, is not a fan of my cat Sonny, and vice versa. But that doesn’t stop us from being BFF’s despite this obstacle.</p>

We grew up surfing and playing volleyball together. Although he now lives in Northern California and I don’t get to see him as much as I would like, he is still one of my best friends and when we do get together, we can pick up right where we left off.</p>

Jon went to UC Irvine, and when I decided to transfer to CSULB, it made perfect sense for us to become roommates. We lived together for over 3 years in Huntington Beach during college and had some great times. Jon is a good friend, an excellent father, and one of the most intelligent guys I know.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">I have known Brad for about 20 years, since middle school as well. We became closer friends during college, as San Diego was just a short trip from Huntington and vice versa, and he is my most recent roommate. We always have a blast watching football, playing soccer, drinking some beers and just joking around.  He has been a good friend all this time and I am excited he has agreed to be one of my groomsmen.</p>

John Alan is like a brother to Anita, so we felt it appropriate to have him up there with us on our big day (it should be mentioned his fiance is the Maid of Honor). John Alan is a good guy with a big heart and we are excited for him to be up there with us on our big day.</p>

When Ryan was told that Anita was getting married, he initially was very upset, thinking he would lose her. But when he learned instead of losing Anita, he was gaining a new boy cousin Adam to play video games and Legos with, he immediately got excited vs. sad. We are happy to include them in our ceremony as the herald bearers that will announce the entrance of the bride and exit of the happy couple after the ceremony.</p>
