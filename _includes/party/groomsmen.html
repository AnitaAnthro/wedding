                        <p class="text-left"><br/>Kevin is one of my best friends that I met and lived with during my college and post college years. We initially met when he became “guy who is crashing on our couch for a while”, which shortly transformed to our roommate and good friend.  We lived together for a cumulative total of over 6 years and I just can’t say enough good things about the guy. He is always fun to hang out with and we have enjoyed many good times together whether it’s an out of the country surf trip, an Iron Maiden or Danzig show, or just getting together for a couple beers and some laughs. I am honored that he will be up there for me on the big day.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">Bobby, as I still call him, is also one of my oldest and best friends I have known since middle school. We grew up surfing and playing volleyball together. Although he now lives in Northern California and I don’t get to see him as much as I would like, he is still one of my best friends and when we do get together, we can pick up right where we left off.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">Jon is one of my oldest and best friends that I have actually known since middle school, but we became pretty close friends in our high school years. Jon went to UC Irvine, and when I decided to transfer to CSULB, it made perfect sense for us to become roommates. We lived together for over 3 years in Huntington Beach during college and had some great times. Jon is a good friend, an excellent father, and one of the most intelligent guys I know.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">I have known Brad for about 20 years, since middle school as well. We became closer friends during college, as San Diego was just a short trip from Huntington and vice versa, and he is my most recent roommate. We always have a blast watching football, playing soccer, drinking some beers and just joking around.  He has been a good friend all this time and I am excited he has agreed to be one of my groomsmen.</p>

                        <h3>John Alan Gable</h3>
                        <p class="text-left">John Alan is always fun to hang out with and I consider him a good friend.  We share many things in common, primarily the love of Road House and Football. John Alan is like a brother to Anita, so we felt it appropriate to have him up there with us on our big day (it should be mentioned his fiance is the Maid of Honor). John Alan is a good guy with a big heart and we are excited for him to be up there with us on our big day.</p>
