                <p class="text-left">The Ceremony & Reception will be held at Mt. Woodson Castle in Ramona, CA. This Historical Castle was built in 1921 as a private residence for Amy Strong, a famous San Diego dress designer. The Strong home in Ramona is the vision of this artistic woman, the talents of her architects, and the philosophy of the Craftsman Movement.

                        <p>*The Residence Inn is a slightly nicer hotel with a nicer pool and patio area, complete with fire pit and BBQ. The rooms here also have full kitchens and are larger than the Springhill Suite rooms. This is where the entire wedding party will be staying, and for those that will want to continue the party after the wedding ends at 10pm, we have reserved a separate area near the front lobby of the Residence Inn away from any guest rooms to do so. </p>
